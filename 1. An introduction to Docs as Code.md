# An introduction to Docs as Code
Documentation as Code (also known as _Docs as Code_ or _DaC_) is a way for technical writers and developers to create and publish documents using the same tools and processes used to write code. This approach is quickly gaining popularity among software teams.

Using a DaC approach reduces manual work, allowing documentation writers to focus on creating accurate, usable information. It also helps ensure that all your documentation shares a consistent structure and language. Another aspect of the DaC process is the ability to automatically test for formatting and style errors and ensure a new version of the documentation is ready for deployment.

In other words, docs as code is an approach to creating and delivering documentation for software. Docs as code means that you treat the documentation in the same way as the code. 

The docs as code approach combines two important aspects:  

- You use the same tooling as the developers, such as version control and continuous integration. 

- You use the same methods as the developers, for example agile project management.
