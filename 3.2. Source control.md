# Source control
Source control is essential for keeping track of changes, including who made them and when. Development teams should be familiar with a version control system (VCS) that monitors application code, so you can use the same VCS for writing and storing documentation. You can store documentation in a dedicated repository or distribute it together with the relevant source code.

Git-based versioning platforms like GitHub and GitLab encourage collaboration between developers and writers, by showing the changes made to every file, with a dedicated space for discussing and explaining the changes. Teams can make granular decisions to accept or reject changes to the documentation.

Another benefit of a versioning tool is the ability to work asynchronously with multiple contributors to one file. Branches allow individual team members to create their file versions and merge changes without impacting other contributors nor the original file. A versioning platform also provides an interface that facilitates conflict reporting and resolution.
