# Docs as Code and Markdown
One of the most popular tools or better to say language used in the DaC method is Markdown.

Markdown was created as a web language to simplify the complex HTML language with its tags and elements. Markdown defines basic concepts, for example, how to write lists or create markup. Markdown is not standardized and due to its origin as an open language, there are multiple flavours, which are developed and used by different platforms and organizations. That means, companies can choose the bundles they need for their requirements. 

Markdown is easy to learn and by far the most common docs as code language. Nearly all advanced text editors offer Markdown support. The transformation from Markdown to HTML is simple.
