# What is a static site generator?
A static site generator is a tool that generates a full static HTML website based on raw data and a set of templates. Essentially, a static site generator automates the task of coding individual HTML pages and gets those pages ready to serve to users ahead of time. Because these HTML pages are pre-built, they can load very quickly in users' browsers.

Static site generators are an alternative to content management systems (CMS) â€” another type of tool for managing web content, generating webpages, and implementing templates. (A template is a reusable format for web content; developers use templates to avoid writing the same formatting over and over.)

A static site generator works by taking source files, such as Markdown or HTML, and converting them into a set of static HTML files. The source files can be written in a variety of languages, such as Markdown, HTML, or JavaScript. The generator then uses templates to add a consistent layout and design to the HTML files. Once the HTML files are generated, they can be served by any web server.
