# Keeping documentation and code in sync

When a page in the documentation is outdated, it can confuse new employees, remote workers, or end users, thus impacting productivity. If you keep documentation in a separate system, development teams often forget about it - in the worst case, there is no clear source of truth for documentation.

Disorganized documentation can increase technical debt. Keeping documentation next to code can help keep it up to date. Developers can update the docs when they change the code - the local availability of documentation also allows developers to update and search sections themselves, rather than rely on a technical writer. However, this still requires ongoing vigilance by developers to update the documentation. Documentation as code solutions can help reduce this burden by updating documentation automatically.
