# Using the same tools to review documentation and code

Most organizations manage code changes with pull request workflows - developers submit changes for review before publishing to the code base. The code reviews aim to promote collaboration while standardizing workflows and maintaining code quality.

With DaC, you use the same system to review documentation. If the team fails to update the documentation when making a change, the code review should catch it. You could use documentation previews for all pull requests to help reviewers check the documentationâ€™s accuracy.
