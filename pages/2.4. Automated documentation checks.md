# Automated documentation checks

Publishing documentation as part of the CI/CD pipeline (Continuous Integration & Continuous Delivery) lets you automate documentation checks. This can be anything from detecting broken links, enforcing style guides or fixing formatting. Want to generate PDF versions of your docs? Do it as part of your documentation pipeline.
