# Documentation versioning

Documentation versioning is important if your project has multiple software versions that are used in parallel - it is critical to clarify which software version the documentation relates to. Most documentation tools have versioning features, but it is still time-consuming to keep documentation in sync. With DaC, when you create a new branch on your repository (new version of code), the new branch in your documentation is created, so versioning is done automatically.
