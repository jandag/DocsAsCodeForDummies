# Plain text authoring



The Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is developersâ€™ most widely used tool, including for documentation. Development teams should write all documentation in plain text for easy reading and editing in the IDE. It is common to use simple languages like [Markdown]({% link pages/4. Docs as Code and Markdown.md %}) (but also reStructuredText or Asciidoc) to delineate formatting.



There are three key advantages of the plain text approach:



- A unified tool and language allow developers to find code easily and avoid distracting context switches.



- Plain text is compatible with every IDE and easy for humans to read. Most operating systems support plain-text files, and many open source tools allow non-technical individuals to work with them.



- Plain-text documentation helps focus on technical content without distractions like layout considerations. Formatting should be basic, with features such as headings, tables, text highlighting, hypertext links, bullets, and numbers.
