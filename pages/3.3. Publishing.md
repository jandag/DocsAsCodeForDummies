# Publishing

After writing, versioning, and saving the documentation, you can publish it - ideally in a plain-text format. Creating static web pages with a [Static Site Generator (SSG)](/ssg/) makes it easier to convert plain-text files to HTML. SSGs let you enhance your brand using CSS stylesheets and add dynamic JS sections. Everything is rendered on the server side.

With an SSG, you can decouple content from the final graphics. Developers only handle technical content, and another team can handle the visuals. This approach saves developers time because they don’t need to address formatting. It also makes editing easier because the style applies to all pages.

SSGs usually offer features to enhance your content’s usability without requiring extra intervention by developers. These may include search bars, navigation menus, a homepage, a contents page, and documentation displays for previous versions.
