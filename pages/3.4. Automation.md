# Automation

Another advantage of DaC is that it supports automation the same way you might automate a CI/CD pipeline for source code. Continuous integration practices let you build automated tests to check the content whenever someone makes a Pull or Merge request. These tests identify formal and technical errors in the documentation (e.g., invalid links, typos, incorrect punctuation).

You can then leverage continuous delivery (CD) to automate the detection and publishing of changes in the main branch - this saves time when publishing new content. Combining CI and CD automation helps speed up the overall documentation process and reduce errors.
